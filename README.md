# Your Story
[View the demo video here]( )

This is a project about Your Story. It's a project for recording a familiarity, of sharing your pride. It's a project of identity and love, of growth and acceptance. It's a project about you, and us, and everyone in their togetherness. We hope Your Story can serve as a way of connecting with others who share your experiences, to be a platform where you can feel empowered in your identity and affirmed by the reflection of what deserves the most love, yourself, that you can see on the faces and in the stories of people who choose to share them. 

## Features
The features of our web application will empower this self-expression by showing people that they are not alone in their pride. After an initial log-in or account creation page, which requires email confirmation for first time users, there will be three distint features available. The first is to *explore*, which involves passing through unread stories posted by others. We have programmed this feature to only allow the exploration of a given story once, with the user passing through all the posts sequentially. The only way for a user to see that post again is to save it, or comment on it, which saves the post by default. This leads to the second action, which is to view saved stories. This allows for conversations to take place on posts, facilitating validation through exchange. Finally, a logged in user can post their stories, which will be entered into their list of saved posts by default. A story can be whatever its writor wants it to be. In regards to tools, our implementation at the time of the Hackathon allows for the use of both text and images in the writing and sharing of a story. We look forward to implementing this, along with several other features, in the time we'll have after the end of PrideMakers. 

## Future Additions
Such features would be notifications, which will collect within both the web-app itself and will, using communication platforms like Twilio, also be sent out at the user's descretion as push notifications. Furthermore, we would like to further tighten security by using a cryptography key and a password, which for the purposes of the Hackathon weren't necessary. 

## Languages Used and Final Thanks
Your Story is a web application developed using Node-JS, CSS, and HTML. We used MongoDB as our database program and host our website yourstory-pride.com on AWS. We'd like to thank the sponsors of PrideMakers, particularly Amazon Web Services, IMC Trading Unthinkable (go Team Liquid!), IMC Trading, SAP, and Hackclub. AWS in particular was an essential part of our project, 

Thank you for looking at our project! From:
