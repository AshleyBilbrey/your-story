# Your Story
[View the demo video here]( )

This is a project about Your Story. It's a project for recording a familiarity, of sharing your pride. It's a project of identity and love, of growth and acceptance. It's a project about you, and us, and everyone in their togetherness. We hope Your Story can serve as a way of connecting with others who share your experiences, to be a platform where you can feel empowered in your identity and affirmed by the reflection of what deserves the most love, yourself, that you can see on the faces and in the stories of people who choose to share them. 

Your Story is a web application developed using Node-JS, CSS, and HTML. We used MongoDB as our database program and host our website yourstory-pride.com on AWS. We'd like to thank the sponsors of PrideMakers, particularly Amazon Web Services, IMC Trading Unthinkable (go Team Liquid!), IMC Trading, SAP, and Hackclub. Here are our submission details:
